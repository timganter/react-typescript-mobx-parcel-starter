# Static directory

1. Put static files that you need to use in your app here.
1. For example, media files like images or svg files.
1. This folder will get copied over to the `./dist` directory when running the command `npm run build`. 
1. You can copy this folder to `dist` anytime by running `npm run copyStatic`. Maybe you have `npm run start` running and you place a new image in your `static` folder that you would like to use. Run `npm run copyStatic` to copy it over so that your app can access it.
